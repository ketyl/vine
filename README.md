## Vine

Vine is a simple PHP 8.0 micro-framework, written from the ground-up. This is more of a learning experience for me and is **not** intended to be production-ready, nor is it going to be in the future.

Inspired by popular PHP frameworks such as Laravel and Slim, Vine maintains a focus on developer experience.
